# Just sandbox of some simple thinks I'm trying

Is started from `java_sandbox`, but with time I'm using it to another
programming languages I'm working with, just some simple things in general,
some simple block, and practicing some thing with personal notes I'm placing here.
Also if I'm larning some new language or diff technical stuff,
not related with work etc, it reflecting here first of all,
where I always can back to here and pick it up, remember, text some things
based on it an so on, and so on.

In general, it's have no any value exept me :)
