    An `Applicative Functor`` is a normal Functor with some extra features provided by the
    `Applicative Type Clas`s.

    Using Functor, we usually map an existing function with another function defined inside it.
    But there is no any way to map a function which is defined inside a `Functor` with `another Functor`.
    That is why we have another facility called `Applicative Functor`.
    This facility of mapping is implemented by `Applicative Type class` defined under the `Control` module.
    This class gives us only two methods to work with: one is `pure` and the other one is `<*>`.

    Following is the class definition of the Applicative Functor.

        class (Functor f) => Applicative f where
            pure :: a -> f a
            (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

{-
    According to the implementation, we can map another Functor using two methods: "Pure" and "<*>".
    The "Pure" method should take a value of any type and it will always return an `Applicative Functor` of that value.

    The following example shows how an Applicative Functor works âˆ’

f1 :: (Num a) => a -> a -> a
f1 x y = 2 * x + y

example1 = do
    putStrLn "--->>> Applicative Functor: "
    print . show $ f1 <$> Just 1 <*> Just 2

example2 = do
    putStrLn "--->>> :"

main = do
    putStrLn ">>>>>--------------EXAMPLE1--------------<<<<<"
    example1
    putStrLn "\n>>>>>--------------EXAMPLE2--------------<<<<<"
