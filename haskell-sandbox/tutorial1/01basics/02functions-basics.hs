    -- Guards is a concept that is very similar to pattern matching. In pattern
    -- matching, we usually match one or more expressions, but we use guards to
    -- test some property of an expression.

    -- developerâ€™s perspective, guards is more readable and simple. For first-time
    -- users, guards can look very similar to If-Else statements, but they are
    -- functionally different.

-- Where is a keyword or inbuilt function that can be used at runtime to generate
-- a desired output. It can be very helpful when function calculation becomes complex.

-- Consider a scenario where your input is a complex expression with multiple
-- parameters. In such cases, you can break the entire expression into small
-- parts using the "where" clause.

-- In the following example, we are taking a complex mathematical expression.
-- We will show how you can find the roots of a polynomial
-- equation [x^2 - 8x + 6] using Haskell.
