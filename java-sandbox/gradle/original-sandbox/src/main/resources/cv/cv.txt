SUMMARY
With over 10 years of experience as a software engineer, I specialize in creating diverse solutions ranging from server applications to SDKs and client apps. My expertise spans object-oriented programming principles, HTTP, concurrency, microservices architecture, high-load systems, optimizations, algorithms, software design patterns, and more. I am well-versed in SOLID, GRASP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Clean Architecture, and other best practices, which I rigorously adhere to in my work to ensure clean, extensible, flexible, fast, and robust code. My recent focus has been on Java, although I also have a strong background in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and related technologies/frameworks. Additionally, I have experience in project leadership roles, ensuring successful project delivery and value generation for businesses across various iterations and project lifecycles.

Responsibilities:
- Leading `Order Domain` project
- Developing new microservices, features, and functionalities
- Optimizing performance and conducting refactoring tasks

Main achievements:
- Optimized numerous complex SQL queries to improve database performance.
- Led the development of critical microservices and integrations for the "Orders" domain on the platform. This included the creation of microservices, 3rd party integrations, sinks, consumers, and more. Successfully implemented an asynchronous flow using Kafka to synchronize orders from various sources, normalize configurations, and seamlessly integrate with the legacy slow system. Implemented comprehensive recovery flows and notifications.
- Designed and implemented a mechanism for order synchronization between two major systems, reducing the number of expensive calls by leveraging on-demand user requests and order notification mechanisms.
- Developed an order notification mechanism to track real-time changes in orders from the legacy slow system system, allowing clients to monitor order progress effectively.
- Engineered a concurrent TcpClientConnectionFactory to connect with PED terminals, laying the foundation for the platform's payment system.
- Enhanced the legacy slow system system proxy microservice to optimize connection management with the legacy slow system system, significantly reducing licensing costs and improving connection efficiency by using `kafka streams`.
- Created a custom lightweight indexed full-text search solution based on PostgreSQL (tsvector, tsquery), enabling the implementation of complex and fast search engines across the platform without the need for expensive third-party search platforms like Elasticsearch or Algolia.
- Introduced the `Clean Architecture` principle to the project, collaborating with other leads to establish a unified service creation and refactoring architecture. This initiative significantly simplified support efforts, streamlined extension processes, and facilitated the integration of new client services into various domains.
