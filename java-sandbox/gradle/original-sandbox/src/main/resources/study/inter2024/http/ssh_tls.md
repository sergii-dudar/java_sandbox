# tcp handshake vs tcp tls handshake

The TCP handshake and the TCP/TLS handshake (also known as the TLS/SSL handshake) share similarities in their initial steps but diverge when it comes to securing the communication channel. Let's compare the two handshakes:

## TCP Handshake:
### SYN (Synchronize): 
- The client sends a TCP segment with the SYN (synchronize) flag set to the server to initiate a connection request.
- The segment includes an initial sequence number (ISN) chosen by the client.

### SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge):
- Upon receiving the SYN segment, the server responds with a TCP segment containing both the SYN and ACK (acknowledge) flags set. This is the SYN-ACK segment.
- The server selects its own ISN and acknowledges the client's ISN, synchronizing sequence numbers.

### ACK (Acknowledge):
- The client acknowledges the server's ISN, completing the three-way handshake.
- The connection is now established, and both sides can transmit data.

## TCP/TLS Handshake:
### ClientHello:
- The TLS handshake begins with the client sending a "ClientHello" message to the server.
- The "ClientHello" includes supported TLS versions, cipher suites, and other parameters.

### ServerHello:
- The server responds with a "ServerHello" message, selecting the highest supported TLS version and a cipher suite from the client's list.
- The server may also send its digital certificate for authentication.
 
### Key Exchange and Authentication:
- If needed, a key exchange method is performed to establish a shared secret key for encryption. This can involve public-key cryptography (asymmetric) or a pre-shared key.
- The server's digital certificate is used for authentication, and the client may also send its certificate if required.

### Finished:
- Both the client and server exchange "Finished" messages, indicating that the handshake is complete.
- The shared secret key is now established, and the communication is encrypted.

## Differences:

### Security:
- The primary distinction is that the TCP handshake only establishes an unencrypted connection. In contrast, the TLS handshake includes additional steps for securing the communication through encryption and authentication.

### Encryption and Authentication:
- The TCP/TLS handshake involves negotiating cryptographic parameters, exchanging digital certificates, and establishing a shared secret key for encrypting the data. This provides confidentiality and integrity for the communication.

### Protocol Layer:
- The TCP handshake operates at the transport layer, focusing on establishing a basic, unencrypted connection. The TCP/TLS handshake operates at a higher layer (application layer) and includes steps specific to the TLS/SSL protocol for secure communication.

*In summary, while both handshakes initiate a connection between a client and a server, the TCP/TLS handshake includes additional steps to establish a secure, encrypted communication channel. The TLS handshake is commonly used to secure various application layer protocols, such as HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) for secure web browsing.*

# Asymmetric Cryptography public and private keys

*Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, involves the use of a pair of keys for secure communication. This pair consists of a public key and a private key, and each key has a specific role in the encryption and decryption processes.*

## Public Key:

- Distribution: The public key is shared openly and can be distributed widely.
- Encryption: Anyone can use the public key to encrypt messages or data. Once encrypted with the public key, the information can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.
- Authentication: Public keys are used for verifying digital signatures. If a message is signed with a private key, anyone with the corresponding public key can verify the signature's authenticity.

## Private Key:

- Secrecy: The private key is kept confidential and is known only to the key owner.
- Decryption: The private key is used to decrypt messages or data that were encrypted with the corresponding public key. Only the owner of the private key can perform this decryption.
- Signing: Private keys are used to create digital signatures. If a message is signed with a private key, anyone with the corresponding public key can verify the signature's authenticity.

## How Asymmetric Cryptography Works:

### Encryption:
- Sender (Alice): Alice obtains Bob's public key.
- Encryption: Alice encrypts the message with Bob's public key.
- Transmission: Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob.
- Decryption: Bob, the recipient, uses his private key to decrypt the message.

### Digital Signature:
- Sender (Bob): Bob uses his private key to create a digital signature for a message.
- Transmission: Bob sends both the original message and the digital signature to Alice.
- Verification: Alice, the recipient, uses Bob's public key to verify the digital signature. If the verification is successful, Alice can be confident that the message was signed by someone possessing Bob's private key.

# how client gets public key to encrypt data?

*When a client establishes a secure HTTPS connection with a server, the server provides its public key to the client as part of the SSL/TLS handshake. This process allows the client to encrypt data using the server's public key for secure communication. Here's a step-by-step overview:*

## Client Hello:
- The client initiates the SSL/TLS handshake by sending a "ClientHello" message to the server.
- This message includes information about the client's supported cryptographic algorithms, SSL/TLS versions, and other parameters.

## Server Hello:
- Upon receiving the "ClientHello," the server responds with a "ServerHello" message.
- The "ServerHello" includes information about the selected cryptographic algorithms and the chosen SSL/TLS version.

## Server Certificate:
- As part of the handshake, the server sends its digital certificate to the client.
- The digital certificate contains the server's public key, information about the server's identity (such as its domain), and the digital signature from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

## Certificate Verification:
- The client verifies the authenticity of the server's certificate. This involves checking the CA's digital signature and ensuring that the certificate is still valid.
- If the verification is successful, the client proceeds with the handshake. If not, the connection may be terminated.

## Key Exchange:
- Depending on the selected key exchange algorithm, the server and client perform a key exchange to establish a shared secret.
- In the case of public-key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography), the server's public key is used to facilitate the key exchange.

## Session Key Derivation:
- Using the shared secret obtained from the key exchange, the client and server independently derive a session key. This session key is used for symmetric encryption during the remainder of the session.

## Encryption:
- The client and server now have a shared session key, which they use for symmetric encryption of the data transmitted during the HTTPS session.
- The server's public key is mainly used during the initial handshake for secure key exchange, not for encrypting the actual data.

## Secure Communication:
- With the shared session key, both the client and server can securely encrypt and decrypt the data transmitted between them. This ensures confidentiality and integrity for the duration of the session.

*It's important to note that the server's public key is used primarily during the handshake to establish a secure channel for the exchange of symmetric session keys. Once the secure channel is established, symmetric encryption (using the derived session key) is more computationally efficient for encrypting the actual data transmitted during the HTTPS session.*
