WORK EXPERIENCE
  * May 2021 – Present
    Senior Java software engineer at Digitally Inspired company, 
      City Plumbing | Plumbing &amp; Heating Merchants, Bathroom Stores: UK's largest builders' merchants, supplying tens of thousands of trade quality products that are available for contact free delivery or collection (main public site https://www.cityplumbing.co.uk/)

Responsibilities &amp; Main Achievements
- system architecture building and supporting
- technical problems solving
- code reviews
- performance optimizations &amp; refactoring
 - optimization of existing sql complex queries, and developing new
 - developed from scratch one of the core platform domain `Orders` number of microservices, 3rd party integrations, sinks, consumers and many more. Creation orders from huge number of sources (sales channels) with different configurations, normalizations etc, and sync in handling system called `Universe` (40 years old actually) in fully async flow (by using kafka and many more), with full set of recovery flows, support notifications, ability to recovery and fix.
 - developed mechanism of order synchronization between two big system based on on demand user calls (that in result allowed to decreace number of expencive calls, as communication with `Universe` system is expencive and allowed by small number of licenced socket connections), and based on order notification mechanism, that's allowed to clients see in `the platform` huge number of applications and sites `orders` changes in real time.
 - developed order notifications mechanism of loading `Order` changes from `Universe` about order progress (status changes, attribute changes etc) that allowed to clients to trach order progress.
 - developed cuncurrent `TcpClientConnectionFactory` to connect with `PED` terminals (payment terminals, broadly using in UK big mals), that allowed in resuld built the platform payment system based on it.
 - extended `universe-kafka-proxy` (central microservice to cummunication with `Universe` system by using kafka request\response topics) to use `long lived sessions` of connections with `Universe` with concurrently safe closing\opening old\new connections, keeping them in live state as much as possible, that in result saved to company a lot of money on `Universe` connections licences (that quite expencive), as in result number of needed connections was decreaded almost in 3-5 times to serve the same platform need as before it, but speed and effective of using this connections and `universe-kafka-proxy`  in general increaded a lot.
 - developed custom light weigh indexed full text search solution based on postgres (tsvecrot, tsquery) with supporting any table text columnts, that allowed to resolve many busines requirements and build in result many very complex fast search engines to whole platform without need to move many of searches to 3td party search platforms like `elastic search` or `algolia` that quite expencive, but not all the time justified for many cases by many reasones.
