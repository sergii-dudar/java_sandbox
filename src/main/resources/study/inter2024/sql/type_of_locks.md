Optimistic Locking:

- How it works: In optimistic locking, the system assumes that conflicts between multiple transactions are rare. Instead of locking a resource while it's being accessed, the system allows multiple transactions to read and potentially modify the resource simultaneously.
- Implementation: When a transaction wants to update a resource, it first reads the resource's current state. Before making changes, it checks if the resource has been modified by another transaction. If no changes are detected, the transaction proceeds with the update; otherwise, it aborts or takes corrective action.
- Advantages:
    Generally better for systems with low contention, where conflicts are infrequent.
    Allows for higher concurrency as transactions don't block each other during reads.
    
Pessimistic Locking:

How it works: Pessimistic locking, on the other hand, assumes that conflicts are more likely to occur. When a transaction wants to access a resource, it locks the resource to prevent other transactions from accessing or modifying it until the lock is released.
Implementation: Different types of locks can be used, such as shared locks for reading and exclusive locks for writing. Transactions explicitly acquire and release locks during their execution.
Advantages:
Guarantees data consistency by preventing multiple transactions from accessing or modifying the same resource simultaneously.
Easier to reason about in certain scenarios, especially when contention is high.

Choosing Between Optimistic and Pessimistic Locking:

Concurrency Requirements: If the system experiences high contention for resources, pessimistic locking may be more appropriate to ensure data consistency.
Performance Considerations: In scenarios where conflicts are rare, optimistic locking may provide better performance by allowing more concurrent access.
Complexity: Optimistic locking often requires more careful handling of conflicts and additional logic to manage them. Pessimistic locking can be simpler to implement but may introduce bottlenecks.
